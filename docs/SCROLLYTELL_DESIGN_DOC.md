# LLM ScrollyTell Design Document

## Summary

*Note: Paths referenced in this document are relative to the trustbuilder-ai-platform project root.*

#### Description

This is an educational project to inform users about the capabilities, risks, and shortcomings of LLMs.  It is presented in a news-like scrolly-telling style in which the user scrolls through messages that are interleaved with textual summaries and animated graphs.

To further enhance the user interactivity of this project, there are two additional views: chat, and tree. All three views (scrollytell, chat, tree) use the same theme and styling to present LLM messages, but each has a different intent and flow for presenting the LLM data.  The chat view is a linear display of LLM messages without textual summaries or animated graphs, and the tree view presents a branching conversational interface.

#### Directory Structure

To be determined in accordance with existing directory structure for project.

#### Libraries to Install

[React Scrollama](https://github.com/squirrelsquirrel78/react-scrollama)  
Drvies the scrollytell view, the display, the positional triggers, etc.  

[React D3JS](https://github.com/react-d3-library/react-d3-library)  
Renders graph data on the scrollytell view.  

[LLM UI](https://github.com/richardgill/llm-ui)  
Styles the LLM messages on all three views.  

[Dagre](https://reactflow.dev/examples/layout/dagre)  
Used to render the message tree on the tree view.

## Interface

### <u>Default Interface and Common Elements</u>

The header contains the text "TrustBuilder" and links to the three views described below.  The default view is Scrollytell. The chat interface on all three views use the LLM UI interface to present LLM messages.

Three icons are at the top of the page and they represent links to the graph view, linear message list of just the messages from the LLM and user, and messages in the scrollama style.

### <u>Views</u>

#### Scrollytell

This view display LLM messages interleaved with text and animated graphs. Uses stylings from the LLM UI library.

In the scrollytelling interface, every message should have two links at the top, in a similar style to the links that exist in the chatgpt interface.  The two links should be for: fork and graph view.  Graph view will present the messages in a tree, the default path of the tree will come from the sample.

#### Chat

Similar to chatgpt style interface but with discrete message displays (as opposed to ChatGPT's more linear text displays). Uses styling from the LLM-UI library.

#### Tree

Displays the LLM conversation entries in a tree structure using the ReactFlow Dagre library. The messages themsleves use styling from the LLM-UI library.

## Behavior

#### Scrollytell Message Behavior

As the user scrolls, the individual LLM messages are played out in a streaming LLM style, starting when the first line of the message appears on the page and only starting if the content of the prior message has been fully displayed. When a message is three fourths of the way up the page its content is fully displayed, and accordingly the number of words displayed at a time is a function of the position on the page, the time that it has bene streaming, and whether it the content of the message prior to it has been fully displayed.

Once an LLM message has started to animate and stream words, it does not pause unless the user scrolls up and text is not removed until and unless the user scrolls up such that the text is no longer visible.

In between the LLM messages, there will be text and graphs that are animated on trigger, in the classic scrollama style as seen  <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-billionaire-playbook-how-sports-owners-use-their-teams-to-avoid-millions-in-taxes">here</a>.

The animated graphs on that page start after the text
"ProPublicaâ€™s analysis of the tax records, court documents, corporate registration data and news reports." Review that page and describe in detail how it does what it does.

## Data

### <u>Data Model</u>

```
interface MessageContainer {
    id: number  // int >= 1
    parent_message_id: number | null
    message: Message
}

type MessageTree = MessageContainer[]

let currentChatLeafId: number
```

The MessageContainer id field is an int greater than or equal to 1.

The Message type is defined in src/backend_client/types.gen.ts and relevant fields it contains are `role` and `content`.

MessageTree is the source of truth for all message content on the page and informs the message display order for both the tree and chat views.

The currentChatLeafId represents the leaf of the currently displayed chat message sequence in the the chat view. The full sequence is composed according to the logic above.

#### Message Display Order Interpretation

All `parent_message_id` fields must be null, 0, or contain an id that is present in one of the MessageContainer objects in the MessageTree. If the `parent_message_id` field of the n+1st message is null, its parent (i.e. preceding message) in the graph and chat views is the nth message. If the `parent_message_id` field of the first message in the MessageTree list is null or 0 it is a tree root. Any message that contains a `parent_message_id` of 0 is a tree root.


```
interface ScrollyTellData {
    scrolly_tell_sections: ScrollyTellSection[]
}

interface ScrollyTellSection {
    message_ids?: number[]
    data: VisualData | TextData
    metadata: any
}
```

A ScrollyTellSection with no messages displays just the text or visual data.

```
interface VisualData {
    data: any
    type: string
    label: any
    metadata: any
}
```

The type value of a VisualData object is interpreted in-code algorithmically as is the metadata.  The data can be any data that informs the display of some visual element.  E.g. on a bar graph it might contain an array of integers.


```
interface TextData {
    data: any
    type: string
    label: any
    metadata: any
}
```

The type value of a TextData object is interpreted in-code algorithmically as is the metadata.  The data can be any data used for representing text -- e.g. HTML, markdown, plain text.

#### ScrollyTellData Example #1

```
// Set the current chat leaf to the last message in the main branch
const currentChatLeafId = 10;

// Define the ScrollyTellSection objects using existing data variables
const section1: ScrollyTellSection = {
  message_ids: [1, 2, 3],
  data: modelInfoCard
};

const section2: ScrollyTellSection = {
  // Visual only section - no message_ids
  data: aiUsageData
};

const section3: ScrollyTellSection = {
  message_ids: [4, 5],
  data: glossaryEntry
};

const section4: ScrollyTellSection = {
  message_ids: [6, 7, 8, 9],
  data: modelInfoCard  // Reusing this for the breaking point section
};

const section5: ScrollyTellSection = {
  message_ids: [10],
  data: glossaryEntry  // Reusing for the final section
};

// Complete ScrollyTellData object
const scrollyTellData: ScrollyTellData = {
  scrolly_tell_sections: [
    section1,
    section2,  // Visual only - has no message_ids
    section3,
    section4,
    section5
